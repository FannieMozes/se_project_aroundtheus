# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!

# Around the U.S

This is the third project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen.

- The project was created using HTML and CSS, based on the Figma design (https://www.figma.com/file/ii4xxsJ0ghevUOcssTlHZv/Sprint-3%3A-Around-the-US?node-id=0%3A1)

## Project Description

Around the U.S. is an interactive site designed for users to explore and share images of landscapes and travel destinations in the United States.
Users can create and manage their profiles, add and remove photos, and like images uploaded by other users.
The platform aims to enhance the travel experience by showcasing stunning visuals and providing a community for travel as well as photo enthusiasts.

## Key Features

User Profiles: Users can set up their profiles with a personal avatar and description.
Photo Management: Users can add new images, remove their photos, and like other users's pictures.
Gallery Section: A dynamic gallery that displays various images from different locations, allowing users to discover new places and travel destination.

## Technologies and Techniques Used

- HTML5: Structured the web pages with semantic HTML elements for better accessibility.

- CSS: used for styling the webpage, including layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual presentation.

- Flexbox: A layout model used on elements to align and distribute space within the container efficiently.

- Grid Layout: Grid for the profile and gallery section in order to manage the layout of multiple elements in a structured format, such as the buttons, title/descriptions and images.

- Media Queries: Used for responsive design and user-friendly interfaces at different screen width (styled for mobile-view, tablet-view and desktop-view).

- BEM (Block Element Modifier): Used to enhance code readability and maintainability by clearly defining the structure and relationships of elements.
